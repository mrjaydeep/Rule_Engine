# Rule Engine with AST

## Overview
The **Rule Engine with Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)** application allows users to define, evaluate, and execute business rules dynamically. It leverages AST to parse and evaluate rules written in a custom domain-specific language (DSL), enabling flexible rule management.

## Design Choices
- **Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)**: Utilizes AST for parsing rules, allowing for easy manipulation and evaluation of complex expressions.
- **Modular Architecture**: Divides functionality into separate Python files, each responsible for specific tasks, enhancing maintainability and clarity.
- **Dynamic Rule Evaluation**: Supports dynamic rule creation and evaluation, making the engine adaptable to changing business needs.

## Application Structure
